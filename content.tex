\section{Regression}
% TODO explain the regression problem we have chosen to solve
As it is the most clinically relevant parameter,
and also the most demanding to measure,
we have chosen to attempt to predict the insulin levels
from other, more easily determined variables
(excluding, of course, the class variable).

\section{Classification}

This data set contains an obvious binary attribute
with clinical relevance:
does the patient have diabetes or not?
As such, this question is what we will be
focusing our classification efforts on.
